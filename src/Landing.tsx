      <Question title="How does it work?">
        <p>We take your NZ COVID Pass, deconstruct it, pass it through a custom ZK-SNARK and send it off to the smart contract for minting.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="Does my NZ COVID Pass get saved in the calldata?">
        <p><b>No.</b> We only take a few key parts of your NZ COVID Pass, pass them through a custom ZK-SNARK, then verify the zero knowledge proof of you holding the said pass in the smart contract. An attacker canâ€™t reconstruct your NZ COVID Pass based on the blockchain logs.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="Does my name get saved in the calldata?">
        <p><b>No.</b> We send an anonymized identity of your NZ COVID Pass to the smart contract. To be precise, we send 2<sup>256</sup> hashes of random identities, one of which is yours. An attacker canâ€™t figure out your name without reversing the hash function.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="Do you save my NZ COVID Pass on the backend?">
        <p><b>No.</b> NZ COVID Badge is a stateless decentralized application (Dapp) and doesnâ€™t have a backend.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="Does this website have analytics or telemetry?">
        <p><b>No.</b> This website collects no analytics, telemetry or any other data derived from user actions. The website only communicates with an EVM node RPC endpoint to send and receive information from the blockchain.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="How many badges I can mint?">
        <p>You can only mint <b>1 badge per person</b>. Even if you request a new NZ COVID Pass from <ExternalLink href="https://mycovidrecord.nz" title="mycovidrecord.nz">mycovidrecord.nz</ExternalLink>, your anonymized identity will match against the list of spent anonymized identities and prevent you from minting again.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="Can I sell my NZ COVID Badge?">
        <p>Yes. Although the chance that anyone will buy is infinite small. Donâ€™t expect to recoup the Ether you spent. </p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="Whatâ€™s the mint price?">
        <p>Mint is <b>free</b>, it only costs gas to mint. Although the gas price itself is on the higher side, due to the Elliptic Curve signature and ZK-SNARK verification that happens in the smart contract.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="Whatâ€™s the roadmap?">
        <p>Thereâ€™s <b>no roadmap</b>, the project is finished once the contract has been deployed to mainnet.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="How this project will be promoted?">
        <p>This project will not be promoted.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="How many badges can ever be minted?">
        <p>The contractâ€™s total supply does not have a hard limit but since thereâ€™s only 1 badge per person, the total supply is effectively limited by the New Zealand total population of about 5 million.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="What do I get after mint?">
        <p>You get an ERC721 NZ COVID Badge, nothing more.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="How is this project licensed?">
        <p>The badge asset is released as CC0 (public domain) while the code is licensed under MIT unless specified otherwise.</p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="Has there been an audit done on the contract?">
        <p>No. </p>
      </Question>
      <Question title="What browser should I use?">
        <p>NZ COVID Badge works best in Mozilla Firefox. </p>
